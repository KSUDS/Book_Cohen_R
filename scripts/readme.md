The script that I have is using R programming. 

I drew inspiration and code from Shelby Taylor's code in the STAT4030 R in programming class and from the [webiste](https://semba-blog.netlify.app/11/06/2019/looking-at-the-bible-through-wordcloud-in-r/)

The first section of code is finding the most used words in the Bible that are not stop words, like "the, a, an..."

The second section of code is using the most used words in the book of Matthew 13 to make a word cloud in two different orientations. 

The third section of commented out code is the reference from Shelby Taylor's code using the Jane Austen books dataset from built in package from R.
